# garden-share
Garden share is an application (idea at this point) where gardeners can connect and trade produce.  If you're a foodbank seeking donations, you can also join and make requests of the community.  Or if you're a family in need, you can request food as well.  Any user can also offer or request services in exchange for product or services.  The app will also be a forum for gardening conversation where people can exchange best practices or establish meetups to exchange produce.
