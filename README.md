# garden-share
Garden share is an application (idea at this point) where gardeners can connect and trade produce.  If you're a foodbank seeking donations, you can also join and make requests of the community.  Or if you're a family in need, you request food as well.  There is an option to offer services in exchange for produce as well.  It also allows forums for exchanging gardening tips.
